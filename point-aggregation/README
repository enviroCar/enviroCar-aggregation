# envirCar point aggregation algorithm

This algorithm aggregates enviroCar measurements currently based on distance weighting.
It is currently using a Postgres database to store the final results.
The algorithm can be executed using a bounding box and a distance.
Only measurements in the bounding box will be considered for the aggregation.
If a point lies in the specified distance to another point they will be aggregated.

The algorithm can also be executed on a per-track basis. 
It is currently used to display all enviroCar tracks on a ArcGIS online map [1].
New tracks will automatically be aggregated and will be shown on the map quickly after upload.
